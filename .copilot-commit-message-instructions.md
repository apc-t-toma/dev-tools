# Commit Message Guidelines

1. **Follow Conventional Commit Format with Japanese**
    - Use the format: `type(scope): 日本語での説明`
    - Available types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
    - Example: `feat(auth): ユーザー認証システムを追加`

2. **Keep Subject Line Concise and Clear**
    - Keep the first line under 30 characters to ensure clarity.
    - Use simple, direct expressions for the subject line.
    - Use consistent verb forms in Japanese with specific patterns:
       - New features: `〜を追加`, `〜を実装`, `〜を導入`
       - Fixes: `〜を修正`, `〜を解決`, `〜を訂正`
       - Updates: `〜を更新`, `〜を改善`, `〜を最適化`
       - Deletions: `〜を削除`, `〜を除去`

3. **Provide Detailed Context in Body**
    - For all significant changes, include a detailed body in Japanese. Explain the "what" (what was changed) and, more importantly, the "why" (the reason for the change).
    - Separate the subject line and body with a blank line.
    - Use the body to provide context that couldn't fit in the concise subject line.
    - Use bullet points (`-`) to list multiple items for clarity.
    - When using bullet points, use consistent verb forms, following the same patterns as the subject line.

4. **Use Consistent Scope Names**
    - Use clear, descriptive scope names (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `db`, `auth`).
    - Keep scope names consistent across the project.
    - Scope names must remain in English for consistency.
